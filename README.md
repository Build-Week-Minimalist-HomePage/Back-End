# Back-End

 While having Google as your homepage may be a sensible choice, why not spice it up a little bit? The Minimalist Homepage is exactly what you'd imagine it is: stylish, functional, minimalist and modern. Choose from a set of themes (light, dark, etc) and from a number of widgets (TBD). And of course, the Google search bar will be there too. 

 In this repo, you will find the backend portion of the application.

 Hosted on [Heroku](https://bw-homepage.herokuapp.com/), the RESTful API was built with technologies such as Node.js, Express, and knex.
